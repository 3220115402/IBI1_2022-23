The sequeces of human and cat are most closely related.
The fact that the DNA sequences of humans and cats are highly similar suggests that they have similar origins in evolutionary history. This could mean that there is a common ancestor between them, or 
that they have experienced similar environmental stresses and adaptation processes. Biologically, this similarity can be explained by the fact that they share similar genetic and genomic structures, 
resulting in many similarities in physiology and behavior. This similarity can also provide information about the evolutionary relationship between humans and other species.
