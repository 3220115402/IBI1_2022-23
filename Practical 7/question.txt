#question:Are there places in the world where there have been more than 10000 total infections as of 31 March? If so, where are they?
#corresponding solving code:
filtered_data = covid_data[(covid_data["total_cases"] > 10000) & (covid_data["date"] == "2020-03-31")]
print("Locations with more than 10,000 total infections as of 31 March:")
print(filtered_data["location"].unique())

#the result is
